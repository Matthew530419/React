### 1. Project name: Learning React

### 2. What is React

- `React` is one of libraries with javascript using components. `React` is developed to creat UI(User Interface) and operate callback functions per event easily. `React` is launched in 2013 and the popularity increases rapidly from developers. `React` is used at not only facebook but also other big companies such as uber, netflix, instagram. Most of web application maybe are created with `React`. In case of complicated web application, ususally use MVC pattern. MVC is one of design patterns and application could be defined as model, view, controller. `React` could be classified to veiw layer.

#### 2-1. Difference between framework and library

- In case of framework, it takes a long time to learn framework and developer could learn once again when framework has some of large changes with new concept. In contrast, in case of library, developer could build up function freely because library has not fixed structure such as framework. So, developer could learn library more fun and more easily than framework.

#### 2-2. good things regarding React

- `React` is compatible with previous version when it has new revision. Since huge community was already formed, `React` has updated well-arranged documents continueously. There is possibility that other developers already solved the problem and shared their solution when you face the problem. In addtion, the developer could creat a variety of applications with `React`. In case of using `React`, web application could be created. In case of `React Native`, mobile application could be created. In case of using `React` and `Electron`, desktop application could be created.

- Components have `state()` and `render()`. `state()` contains objects of data. `render()` defines how to display somethings to user. Classified components should be reused and independent. The components of `React` has virtual DOM Tree. In case some of child components are called by `render()` because current component has changes, `React` compares between virtual DOM Tree on his own and previous DOM Tree on browser at first and updates necessary changes at DOM Tree on browser. So, speed of operating application is not slow even though many components are called on virtual DOM Tree.

### 3. Period : 2 day

### 4. Programs needed to operate React

#### 4-1. Node.js

- Javascript runtime environment(framework) that executes javascript code outside a web browser. Thanks to `node.js`, javascript could be operated on everywhere. In addition, `node.js` would be used not only to creat back-end server but also to update server-side rendering.

#### 4-2. npm

- `npm` means program of package manager that could download and update libraries. The developer could install, uninstall and update libraries with `package.json`. `package.json` includes information of libraries such as version, scripts, and so on.

### 5. Resolution of failures

#### 5-1.

- symptom: `npm create react-app test` is installed completely, but I received error message when `npm start` on incorrect path. The incorrect path is `C:\Users\PARK MIN KYU\Downloads\cmder\projects\git\React\basic`. The correct path is `C:\Users\PARK MIN KYU\Downloads\cmder\projects\git\React\basic\test` because `react-app` was installed `test` depository. `package.json` should be needed when react loading. In case of incorrect path, there is no package.json which has `scripts` of start.

- countermeasure: type `npm start` on correct path : `C:\Users\PARK MIN KYU\Downloads\cmder\projects\git\React\basic\test`.

#### 5-2.

- symptom: `yarn create react-app test1` is not installed with error `commnad failed`. `package.json` can not be created.

- countermeasure: `yarn create react-app test1` could be divided to `yarn global add create-react-app` and `create-react-app test1`. Please type commands in sequence. And then, type `yarn start` when path of cmder moves to directory named `test1`.
